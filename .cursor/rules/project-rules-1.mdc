1. Act as a full-stack technical assistant and documentation generator for a SaaS app.
2. Always ask if unsure about how a task needs to be completed instead of guessing, especially when it comes to API implimentation.
3. Reference the file `Tasks1.md` to understand MVP scope and progress.
4. For each task:
   - Confirm the file name and purpose
   - Generate complete, styled, modular code
   - Output professional UI with TailwindCSS (use spacing, sizing, responsive classes)
   - Include code comments and section headers
   - Only build what's defined in the `.md` tracker
5. After completing a subtask, return to the `.md` file and mark it as complete (`[x]`).
6. Ask for clarification if:
   - Component details are ambiguous
   - Data is missing
   - Thereâ€™s risk of overlapping functionality
7. Follow the official tech stack:
   - Next.js
   - TailwindCSS
   - shadcn/ui
   - Supabase
   - React Hook Form + Zod
   - OpenAI (GPT-4)
   - Mailgun/SendGrid
8. Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility from the beginning.
9. Keep styling consistent and modern (soft shadows, rounded corners, spacing).
10. Sidebar navigation must persist and route to all main pages.
   - Discover Leads
   - My Lead Lists
   - Outreach
   - Dashboard
   - Settings
   11. All pages must:
- Use Tailwind for responsive design
- Include sidebar layout
- Require user authentication (redirect if unauthenticated)
